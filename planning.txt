Components: 
General Section
Education Section
Professional Section
Actual CV that takes in props from the other 3 and displays them

The CV will need heavy use of state to pass it down to the sections and the CV will 
be responsible for passing in the callbacks and updating its own display values
along with the callbacks being responsible for updating the sections' display values

THE CV IS ESSENTIALLY THE ENTIRE THING! ONE COLUMN IS THE FORM ANOTHER
IS THE ACTUAL CV




Education and Prof sections need to be able to add more than one w an add button and delete button
This will require objects to be used as state NOT strings


The entire thing will be a form that once submitted, will hide all the inputs and then have an 
edit button that will open the inputs back up


Layout is essentially a 2 column layout. One column is the form, 
the other column is the resume that is being generated as they type


Definitley need to make this look super nice as I want this to be an excellent
project to put on portfolio for React.


Potentially want to look into after form is submitted, adding a button to allow 
CV to be saved as a pdf or printed.

Should be fun!
